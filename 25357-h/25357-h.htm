<span class="i2">The lion hid him in a proper station,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">With weakness aye obliged to bend.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The smallest bird that flits in air<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is quite too much for you to bear;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The slightest wind that wreathes the lake<br /></span>

<span class="i4">The while, my towering form<br /></span>

<span class="i4">And wrestle with the storm.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What seems to you the blast of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To me is but a zephyr's breath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath my branches had you grown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Less suffering would your life have known,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Unhappily you oftenest show<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In open air your slender form,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Along the marshes wet and low,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That fringe the kingdom of the storm.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To you, declare I must,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Dame Nature seems unjust."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then modestly replied the reed:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Your pity, sir, is kind indeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But wholly needless for my sake.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The wildest wind that ever blew<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is safe to me compared with you.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I bend, indeed, but never break.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus far, I own, the hurricane<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Has beat your sturdy back in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But wait the end." Just at the word,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The tempest's hollow voice was heard.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The North sent forth her fiercest child,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dark, jagged, pitiless, and wild.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The oak, erect, endured the blow;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The reed bow'd gracefully and low.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But, gathering up its strength once more,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In greater fury than before,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The savage blast<br /></span>

<h2>The Bat and the Two Weasels.</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">A blundering bat once stuck her head<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Into a wakeful weasel's bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whereat the mistress of the house,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A deadly foe of rats and mice,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">To eat the stranger as a mouse.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"What! do you dare," she said, "to creep in<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The very bed I sometimes sleep in,<br /></span>

<span class="i6">Another weasel's nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This last, of birds a special hater.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">New peril brought this step absurd:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Without a moment's thought or puzzle,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dame weasel opened her peaked muzzle<br /></span>

<span class="i2">"Go, paltry insect, nature's meanest brat!"<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Thus said the royal lion to the gnat.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Think you I tremble at your power or fame?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The ox is bigger far than you;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Yet him I drive, and all his crew."<br /></span>

<span class="i6">Himself he blew the battle charge,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Himself both trumpeter and hero.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">At first he play'd about at large,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then on the lion's neck, at leisure, settled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there the royal beast full sorely nettled.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With foaming mouth, and flashing eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He roars. All creatures hide or fly,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Such mortal terror at<br /></span>
<span class="i8">The work of one poor gnat!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With constant change of his attack,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The snout now stinging, now the back,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And now the chambers of the nose;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The pigmy fly no mercy shows.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The lion's rage was at its height;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">His viewless foe now laugh'd outright,<br /></span>

<span class="i6">Ah! bootless blow, and bite, and curse!<br /></span>
<span class="i6">He beat the harmless air, and worse;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">For, though so fierce and stout,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">By effort wearied out,<br /></span>

<span class="i8">And, fill'd with rage extreme,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The mud-holes now he cursed,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">And now he cursed his team,<br /></span>

<span class="i6">Upon the god he call'd at length,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Most famous through the world for strength.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O, help me, Hercules!" cried he; "for if thy back of yore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This burly planet bore, thy arm can set me free."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This prayer gone up, from out a cloud there broke<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A voice which thus in godlike accents spoke:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">"The suppliant must himself bestir,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Ere Hercules will aid confer.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Look wisely in the proper quarter,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">To see what hindrance can be found;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Remove the execrable mud and mortar,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Which, axle-deep, beset thy wheels around.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Thy sledge and crowbar take,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And pry me up that stone, or break;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Now fill that rut upon the other side.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Hast done it?" "Yes," the man replied.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">"Well," said the voice, "I'll aid thee now;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Take up thy whip." "I have ... but, how?<br /></span>
<span class="i10">My cart glides on with ease!<br /></span>
<span class="i12">I thank thee, Hercules."<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"Thy team," rejoin'd the voice, "has light ado;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">So help thyself, and Heaven will help thee too."<br /></span>

<h2>The Heron.</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">One day,&mdash;no matter when or where,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">A long-legg'd heron chanced to fare<br /></span>
<span class="i6">By a certain river's brink,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">With his long, sharp beak<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Helved on his slender neck;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">'Twas a fish-spear, you might think.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The water was clear and still,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The carp and the pike there at will<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Pursued their silent fun,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Turning up, ever and anon,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">A golden side to the sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With ease might the heron have made<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Great profits in his fishing trade.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">So near came the scaly fry,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">They might be caught by the passer-by.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But he thought he better might<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Wait for a better appetite&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For he lived by rule, and could not eat,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Except at his hours, the best of meat.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Anon his appetite return'd once more;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">So, approaching again the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He saw some tench taking their leaps,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Now and then, from their lowest deeps.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With as dainty a taste as Horace's rat,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He turn'd away from such food as that.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"What, tench for a heron! poh!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I scorn the thought, and let them go."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tench refused, there came a gudgeon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For all that," said the bird, "I budge on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll ne'er open my beak, if the gods please,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For such mean little fishes as these."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He did it for less; | For it came to pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That not another fish could he see;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And, at last, so hungry was he,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That he thought it of some avail<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To find on the bank a single snail.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Our eyes are not made proof against the fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Nor hands against the touch of gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Fidelity is sadly rare,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And has been from the days of old.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Well taught his appetite to check,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And do full many a handy trick,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">A dog was trotting, light and quick,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His master's dinner on his neck.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A temperate, self-denying dog was he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than, with such a load, he liked to be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still he was, while many such as we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would not have scrupled to make free.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange that to dogs a virtue you may teach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, do your best, to men you vainly preach!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This dog of ours, thus richly fitted out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mastiff met, who wish'd the meat, no doubt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To get it was less easy than he thought:<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The porter laid it down and fought.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Meantime some other dogs arrive:<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Such dogs are always thick enough,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And, fearing neither kick nor cuff,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Upon the public thrive.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Our hero, thus o'ermatch'd and press'd,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The meat in danger manifest,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Is fain to share it with the rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And, looking very calm and wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">"No anger, gentlemen," he cries:<br /></span>
<span class="i6">"My morsel will myself suffice;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The rest shall be your welcome prize."<br /></span>
<span class="i6">With this, the first his charge to violate,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">He snaps a mouthful from his freight.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Then follow mastiff, cur, and pup,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Till all is cleanly eaten up.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Not sparingly the party feasted,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And not a dog of all but tasted.<br /></span>

<h2>The Joker and the Fishes.</h2>

<span class="i2">A joker at a banker's table,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Most amply spread to satisfy<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The height of epicurean wishes,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Had nothing near but little fishes.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So, taking several of the fry,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He whisper'd to them very nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And seem'd to listen for reply.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The guests much wonder'd what it meant,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And stared upon him all intent.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The joker, then, with sober face,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Politely thus explain'd the case:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"A friend of mine, to India bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Has been, I fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Within a year,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By rocks or tempests wreck'd and drown'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I ask'd these strangers from the sea<br /></span>

<span class="i6">But all replied they were too young<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To know the least of such a matter&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The older fish could tell me better.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Pray, may I hear some older tongue?"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What relish had the gentlefolks<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For such a sample of his jokes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is more than I can now relate.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They put, I'm sure, upon his plate,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A monster of so old a date,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He must have known the names and fate<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of all the daring voyagers,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who, following the moon and stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Have, by mischances, sunk their bones<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Within the realms of Davy Jones;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And who, for centuries, had seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far down, within the fathomless,<br /></span>

<h2>The Rat and the Oyster.</h2>

<span class="i0">He cried; "there rise the Alps, and that<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His mountains were the works of moles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or dirt thrown up in digging holes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some days of travel brought him where<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tide had left the oysters bare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since here our traveller saw the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thought these shells the ships must be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My father was, in truth," said he,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"A coward, and an ignoramus;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He dared not travel: as for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I've seen the ships and ocean famous;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have cross'd the deserts without drinking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many dangerous streams unshrinking."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the shut-up shell-fish, one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was gaping widely at the sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It breathed, and drank the air's perfume,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Expanding, like a flower in bloom.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Both white and fat, its meat<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Appear'd a dainty treat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our rat, when he this shell espied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thought for his stomach to provide.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or in its flavour half so fine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As that on which to-day I dine."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus full of hope, the foolish chap<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thrust in his head to taste,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No answer&mdash;not a word!&mdash;indeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The truth was, our Arcadian steed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fear'd lest, for every moment's flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His nimble teeth should lose a bite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last, "I counsel you," said he, "to wait<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till master is himself awake,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who then, unless I much mistake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will give his dog the usual bait."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meanwhile, there issued from the wood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A creature of the wolfish brood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself by famine sorely pinch'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At sight of him the donkey flinch'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And begg'd the dog to give him aid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dog budged not, but answer made,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I counsel thee, my friend, to run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till master's nap is fairly done;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There can, indeed, be no mistake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he will very soon awake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till then, scud off with all your might;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And should he snap you in your flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This ugly wolf,&mdash;why, let him feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The greeting of your well-shod heel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I do not doubt, at all, but that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will be enough to lay him flat."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But ere he ceased it was too late;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The ass had met his cruel fate.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">God's works are good. This truth to prove<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Around the world I need not move;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I do it by the nearest pumpkin.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"This fruit so large, on vine so small,"<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Surveying once, exclaim'd a bumpkin&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"What could He mean who made us all?<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Upon that oak it should have hung&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A noble fruit as ever swung<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To grace a tree so firm and strong.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Indeed, it was a great mistake,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">As this discovery teaches,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That I myself did not partake<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His counsels whom my curate preaches.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All things had then in order come;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">This acorn, for example,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Not bigger than my thumb,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had not disgraced a tree so ample.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The more I think, the more I wonder<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To see outraged proportion's laws,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And that without the slightest cause;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God surely made an awkward blunder."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With such reflections proudly fraught,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Our sage grew tired of mighty thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And threw himself on Nature's lap,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beneath an oak, to take his nap.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Plump on his nose, by lucky hap,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">An acorn fell: he waked, and in<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The scarf he wore beneath his chin,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He found the cause of such a bruise<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As made him different language use.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"O! O!" he cried; "I bleed! I bleed!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And this is what has done the deed!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But, truly, what had been my fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had this had half a pumpkin's weight!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I see that God had reasons good,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all His works were understood."<br /></span>

<span class="i6">A hungry fisherman<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of his unfitness for the frying-pan.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The fisherman had reason good&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The troutling did the best he could&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Both argued for their lives.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Now, if my present purpose thrives,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">The prudent fisher's opposite,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A dog once finding far astray,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Prepared to take him as his prey.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The dog his leanness pled;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">"Your lordship, sure," he said,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">The wolf, believing, waived the matter,<br /></span>

<span class="i6">Return'd with sole design to see<br /></span>

<h2>The Cat and the Fox.</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The cat and fox, when saints were all the rage<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Together went upon pilgrimage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our pilgrims, as a thing of course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disputed till their throats were hoarse.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then, dropping to a lower tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They talk'd of this, and talk'd of that,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Renard whisper'd to the cat,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"You think yourself a knowing one:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many cunning tricks have you?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I've a hundred, old and new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All ready in my haversack."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cat replied, "I do not lack,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Though with but one provided;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, truth to honour, for that matter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hold it than a thousand better."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In fresh dispute they sided;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loudly were they at it, when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Approach'd a mob of dogs and men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Now," said the cat, "your tricks ransack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And put your cunning brains to rack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One life to save; I'll show you mine&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A trick, you see, for saving nine."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that, she climb'd a lofty pine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fox his hundred ruses tried,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And yet no safety found.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hundred times he falsified<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The nose of every hound.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was here, and there, and everywhere,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Above, and under ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But yet to stop he did not dare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pent in a hole, it was no joke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet the terriers or the smoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, leaping into upper air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He met two dogs, that choked him there.<br /></span>

<h2>The Monkey and the Cat.</h2>

<span class="i0">Sly Bertrand and Ratto in company sat,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">(The one was a monkey, the other a cat,)<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The neighbours were blameless,&mdash;no mortal could doubt it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Bertrand was thievish, and Ratto so nice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More attentive to cheese than he was to the mice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One day the two plunderers sat by the fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where chestnuts were roasting, with looks of desire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To steal them would be a right noble affair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A double inducement our heroes drew there&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twould benefit them, could they swallow their fill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then 'twould occasion to somebody ill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Bertrand to Ratto, "My brother, to-day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exhibit your powers in a masterly way,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And take me these chestnuts, I pray.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Which were I but otherwise fitted<br /></span>
<span class="i4">(As I am ingeniously witted)<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For pulling things out of the flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Would stand but a pitiful game."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"'Tis done," replied Ratto, all prompt to obey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrust out his paw in a delicate way.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">First giving the ashes a scratch,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He open'd the coveted batch;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Then lightly and quickly impinging,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He drew out, in spite of the singeing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One after another, the chestnuts at last,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Bertrand contrived to devour them as fast.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A servant girl enters. Adieu to the fun.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Our Ratto was hardly contented, says one.&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Within the caverns of the pine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With other tenants of that mine,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Of both, the basket and the cage<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Had household gods the same.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bird's sharp beak full oft provoked the cat,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His wee friend sparing with a merry laugh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not punishing his faults by half.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Sir Cat, a person wise and staid,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Excused the warmth with which he play'd:<br /></span>

<span class="i4">To take no joke in serious part.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Familiar since they saw the light,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">"A neighbour's sparrow eating ours!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Not so, by all the feline powers."<br /></span>

<span class="i4">"I know how sparrows taste by that.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Exquisite, tender, delicate!"<br /></span>
<span class="i4">This thought soon seal'd the other's fate.&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Of such a living I am sick.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With far less risk, you've better cheer;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A house you need not venture near,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But I must do it, spite of fear.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The first of all my race that took<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fat mutton to his larder's hook:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Your kindness shall not be repented."<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The wise, sometimes, as lobsters do,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">It is the rower's art; and those<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Commanders who mislead their foes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Do often seem to aim their sight<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Just where they don't intend to smite.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My theme, so low, may yet apply<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To one whose fame is very high,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Who finds it not the hardest matter<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A hundred-headed league to scatter.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What he will do, what leave undone,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Are secrets with unbroken seals,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Till victory the truth reveals.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whatever he would have unknown<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is sought in vain. Decrees of Fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forbid to check, at first, the course<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which sweeps at last the torrent force.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">One Jove, as ancient fables state,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Exceeds a hundred gods in weight.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So Fate and Louis would seem able<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The universe to draw,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Bound captive to their law.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But come we to our fable.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mother lobster did her daughter chide:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For shame, my daughter! can't you go ahead?"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"And how go you yourself?" the child replied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Can I be but by your example led?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Head foremost should I, singularly, wend,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While all my race pursue the other end."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She spoke with sense: for better or for worse,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Example has a universal force.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To some it opens wisdom's door,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But leads to folly many more.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Yet, as for backing to one's aim,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">When properly pursued<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The art is doubtless good,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">At least in grim Bellona's game.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The monkey, master of the arts,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">An animal of brilliant parts,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To hear what he could say.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Great king," the monkey thus began,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"To reign upon the wisest plan<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Requires a prince to set his zeal,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And passion for the public weal,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Distinctly and quite high above<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A certain feeling call'd self-love,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The parent of all vices,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">In creatures of all sizes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To will this feeling from one's breast away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is not the easy labour of a day;<br /></span>

<h2>The Shepherd and the Lion.</h2>

<span class="i0">The Fable &AElig;sop tells is nearly this:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A shepherd from his flock began to miss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And long'd to catch the stealer of, his sheep.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Before a cavern, dark and deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Where wolves retired by day to sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Which he suspected as the thieves,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He set his trap among the leaves;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And, ere he left the place,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He thus invoked celestial grace:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"O king of all the powers divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the rogue but grant me this delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That this my trap may catch him in my sight,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Will make the fattest thine."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But while the words were on his tongue,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Forth came a lion great and strong.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Down crouch'd the man of sheep, and said,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With shivering fright half dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Alas! that man should never be aware<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of what may be the meaning of his prayer!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To catch the robber of my flocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O king of gods, I pledged a calf to thee:<br /></span>

<span class="i4">A wolf who, fall'n on needy days,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">In sharp look-out for means and ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Espied a horse turn'd out to graze.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">His joy the reader may opine.<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Whatever grew about those borders,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He soon could cure of all disorders.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">If he, Sir Horse, would not conceal<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The eagle and the owl, resolved to cease<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Their war, embraced in pledge of peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On faith of king, on faith of owl, they swore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they would eat each other's chicks no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"But know you mine?" said Wisdom's bird.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"Not I, indeed," the eagle cried.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"The worse for that," the owl replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"I fear your oath's a useless word;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I fear that you, as king, will not<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Consider duly who or what:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Adieu, my young, if you should meet them!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Describe them, then, and I'll not eat them,"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The eagle said. The owl replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"My little ones, I say with pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For grace of form cannot be match'd,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The prettiest birds that e'er were hatch'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By this you cannot fail to know them;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Tis needless, therefore, that I show them."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At length God gives the owl a set of heirs,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And while at early eve abroad he fares,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In quest of birds and mice for food,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Our eagle haply spies the brood,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As on some craggy rock they sprawl,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Or nestle in some ruined wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">(But which it matters not at all,)<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And thinks them ugly little frights,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Grim, sad, with voice like shrieking sprites.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"These chicks," says he, "with looks almost infernal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can't be the darlings of our friend nocturnal.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll sup of them." And so he did, not slightly:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He never sups, if he can help it, lightly.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The owl return'd; and, sad, he found<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Nought left but claws upon the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He pray'd the gods above and gods below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To smite the brigand who had caused his woe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth one, "On you alone the blame must fall;<br /></span>
